-- Immediate --
configure all machines (cross compile, optimization flags)
make test all machines (batch queue submission)
buildbot trigger all machines
MPI overhaul

-- MPI --
LBT MPI <- ICELL is being calculated from localBounds
Test difficult distributions for partitioning and LET
MPI-3.0 lock all
cycle counter based weights
2:1 refinement for precomputation
non-orthogonal recursive bisection

-- automake --
Debug MIC, Cray, FX100, SX-ACE (without CC=, CXX= option)
Setup buildbot tests using "make check"
move contents of macros.h to configure.ac
examples/Makefile options to args
unit test for each header file in /unit_test

-- types --
args.h, verify.h from class to namespace
logger.h split to print.h
bodies -> bodies + fields, bodyPos -> bodies, bodyAcc -> fields
AoS, SoA union by Strzodka
Use compressed Cell struct of Bonsai
Remove M, L from Cell struct

-- tree build --
Separate key manipulation namespace, e.g. interleaveMorton(), deinterleveHilbert() (controllable key_t)
Morton -> Hilbert

-- kernels --
Stokes kernels
Have only one P2P
Distinguish Pmax and P. Make P runtime option
Use getIndex for NO_P2P
Kahan + fixed precision
Solid harmonics kernel
hack vecmathlib and import essential features
Helmholtz breaks for very low P
Calculate Flops
Cycle counter kernel timer
FX10 sin, cos, exp intrinsic

-- driver --
Don't try to instantiate all the classes at the top (wait until useful parameters are ready)
TBB -> OpenMP with atomics -> flush
splitRange defined in both dataset.h and partition.h
UVWX-list with precomputation
Periodic B.C. by one precomputed translation matrix
Teng's BH MAC with M2P option during DTT
Interface with BEM code
charmm2: remove repartition inside Ewald & VdW

-- GPU --
CUDA 6.0 debug
Unify dataset
.h -> .cxx/.cu
MPI Bonsai
Ewald, VdW
Zero softening
